# [Bit Counting](https://www.codewars.com/kata/bit-counting/csharp)

---

Write a function that takes an (unsigned) integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number.

Example: The binary representation of `1234` is `10011010010`, so the function should return `5` in this case
